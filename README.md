# Gulp + Webpack example

`npm install`

Watch and build:

`npm start`

or build for production:

`npm run build`

- write your scripts in `src/js/*js`
- `slider.js` example uses slick-carousel installed using npm

## Why use this?

- take advantake of package management: `import` modules from node_modules instead of copying scripts into folders
- `import` other js from paths

## Why Gulp?

It's still the fastest way to compile Sass.
