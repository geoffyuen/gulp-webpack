# Gulp + Webpack example

`npm install`

Watch and build:

```
npm start
```

or build for production:

```
npm run build
```

## Why?

- bundle src/js/*.js
- import modules from node_modules
- import other js from paths
- example uses slick-carousel installed using npm

## Why Gulp?

It's still the fastest way to compile Sass.
